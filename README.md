NHL Salary & Performance Analysis

Exploring the Relationship Between Player Salaries and Performance in the NHL

Project Overview

This project investigates whether an increase in NHL player salaries correlates with improved performance, measured by Points Per Game (PPG). Using Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression with heteroskedasticity-robust standard errors, the analysis examines the impact of various factors such as Games Played (GP), Shots on Goal (SOG), Average Time on Ice (ATOI), Position (POS), and Age (AGE) on player performance.

Key Findings & Methodology
	•	Statistical Modeling: Built multiple regression models to analyze salary’s effect on performance.
	•	Data Analysis & Visualization: Conducted residual analysis, correlation checks, and model validation (R², F-tests, and Akaike/Schwarz criteria).
	•	Key Insight: Salary was found to have an insignificant effect on PPG, suggesting that higher pay does not necessarily lead to increased performance in the NHL.
	•	Future Implications: The model can be adapted for salary cap analysis, player valuation, and predictive sports analytics.
